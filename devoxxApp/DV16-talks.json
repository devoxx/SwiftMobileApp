Twitter, Waze, Slack... users are used to have real-time data in applications they love. But how can you turn your static API into a stream of data?\r\n\r\nWhen talking about data streaming, we often think about WebSockets. But have you ever heard of Server-Sent Events? In this tools-in-action we will compare both technologies to understand which one you should opt for depending on your usecase and I'll show you how we have been even further by reducing the amount of data to transfer with JSON-Patch.\r\n\r\nAnd because real-time data is not only needed by web (and because it's much more fun), I'll show you how we can make drone dance on streamed APIs."},"fromTime":"16:45","toTimeMillis":1478621700000,"toTime":"17:15","roomCapacity":641,"roomName":"Room 5","slotId":"tia_room5_tuesday_8_16h45_17h15","day":"tuesday"},{"roomId":"room8","notAllocated":false,"fromTimeMillis":1478619900000,"break":null,"roomSetup":"theatre","talk":{"trackId":"java","talkType":"Tools-in-Action","track":"Java Language","summaryAsHtml":"<p>Java 8&#x27;s lambdas empower us to create wonderful APIs.

Having a general overview of a type system can provide us information about syntax performance, optimisations and may help us to understand how statements are evaluated. And those are topics that we shall consider for language evolution and development. This talk will provide a gentle introduction to type theory, how it helps us with IDE's and type inference and how can we apply some of its concepts in Java and other languages build on the top of JVM, such as Scala and Clojure, providing a comparison between the type system of such languages. \r\nTopics: \r\n\r\n* Why Type Theory?\r\n* Quick introduction to logic and Lambda Calculus\r\n* Where are those concepts used? \r\n* An analysis of Java Type System \r\n* Clojure Type System\r\n* Scala type system"},"fromTime":"18:55","toTimeMillis":1478629500000,"toTime":"19:25","roomCapacity":393,"roomName":"Room 9","slotId":"tia_room9_tuesday_8_18h55_19h25","day":"tuesday"},{"roomId":"bof1","notAllocated":false,"fromTimeMillis":1478629800000,"break":null,"roomSetup":"classroom","talk":{"trackId":"java","talkType":"BOF (Bird of a Feather)","track":"Java Language","summaryAsHtml":"<p>One of my favorite things to do at conference is to simply get into a room with like minded people and have a group therapy session where we discuss our performance problems and concerns.

We used to run single purpose VMs, which makes sense for  production but for our countless test environments it became prohibitively expensive. Even IaaS is still too slow to provision new environments and bootstrap new applications. This talk will be focusing on the downsides and lessons learned from running JVMs inside containers.\r\n\r\nWe will cover the following topics:\r\n\r\n* The benefits, downsides and complexities of running a Java application inside a container.\r\n* Tuning memory limits taking into account Heap, Native memory, Metaspace, Stacks to avoid being OOM killed\r\n* Tracking native memory with jcmd\r\n* Avoiding the container swap problem\r\n\r\n* Operating system tools that are/are not container aware and when they will come in handy: top, htop, dstat, dmesg, systemd-cgtop\r\n* What tools should you include in your container for debugging/analysis e.g. the Swiss Java Tools https://github.com/aragozin/jvm-tools\r\n* External tools for monitoring containers: prometheus, cadvisor, heapster\r\n* Tuning thread pools for various frameworks"},"fromTime":"15:10","toTimeMillis":1478704200000,"toTime":"16:10","roomCapacity":347,"roomName":"Room 4","slotId":"conf_room4_wednesday_9_15h10_16h10","day":"wednesday"},{"roomId":"room3","notAllocated":false,"fromTimeMillis":1478700600000,"break":null,"roomSetup":"theatre","talk":{"trackId":"lang","talkType":"Conference","track":"Programming languages","summaryAsHtml":"<p>There are two big discussions in the world of programming.

This session explains the process of module resolution in JDK 9 and shows how it avoids errors relative to the class path in JDK 8.  It also explores the double-edged sword of modular accessibility, where the ability to hide a module’s internals must be balanced against the needs of frameworks that perform reflection.  Prepare for a deep dive into module graphs, class loaders, unnamed modules, and the once and future king, setAccessible."},"fromTime":"15:10","toTimeMillis":1478790600000,"toTime":"16:10","roomCapacity":641,"roomName":"Room 5","slotId":"conf_room5_thursday_10_15h10_16h10","day":"thursday"},{"roomId":"room9","notAllocated":false,"fromTimeMillis":1478787000000,"break":null,"roomSetup":"theatre","talk":{"trackId":"mobile","talkType":"Conference","track":"Mobile & Embedded","summaryAsHtml":"<p>The Android framework offers a lot of flexibility when it comes to defining how to organize and architect an Android app. This freedom, whilst very valuable, can also result in apps with large classes, inconsistent naming and architectures (or lack of) that can make testing, maintaining and extending difficult.

What we should be wondering is, will Java 9 it change the way we develop, like Java 8 did?  Will my tools break when I try to use it? Is it worth playing with it before it comes out, or should I just wait until everything stabilises?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, Trisha will take a look at some of the features in Java 9, including modularity, the REPL, and the nice new Collections features.  Trisha will demonstrate, via live coding, these features in IntelliJ IDEA, and talk a bit about the current and future support for Java 9 in IntelliJ IDEA."},"fromTime":"16:40","toTimeMillis":1478796000000,"toTime":"17:40","roomCapacity":286,"roomName":"Room 10","slotId":"conf_room10_thursday_10_16h40_17h40","day":"thursday"},{"roomId":"room8","notAllocated":false,"fromTimeMillis":1478796600000,"break":null,"roomSetup":"theatre","talk":{"trackId":"bigdata","talkType":"Conference","track":"Big Data","summaryAsHtml":"<p>Google has recently open-sourced its framework for machine learning and neural networks called Tensorflow.
