As I observe each community mature, I learn more and more about what makes Open Source tick, what makes a community bond, and how a project can become self-sufficient. After a popular session last year, I’m back to share with you more insight about how to make your Open Source project wildly successful.\r\n\r\nOpen Source works because it’s the right way. Open Source works because it’s the best way. There are no secrets that, once revealed, bring it all crashing down. Even with the cards face up on the table, we always feel amazing when someone thanks us for our contribution. When we don’t get that affirmation, we might decide to vote with our feet and leave.

Why most developers not care about it very much?\r\nWe will discuss the best practices for securing a website or a web app, and even mobile apps. We will include examples of how a minor security bug can affect largest systems and cause millions losses.\r\nWe will also discuss the following:\r\n- Security starts at the planning stage, how to plane your security models from the beginning.\r\n- SQL Injections, XSS Scripts, Predefined Security Models, and many other security threats.\r\n- Self-penetrate your website/web app.\r\n- Think out of the \"developer\" box. Think as the client, and how you can abuse your app in order to find the threats.\r\n- Why you can not make your app threat-proof, and how hackers always find a way to penetrate.\r\nLast but not least we will perform a case study of real life examples of how some glitches harmed most companies, and learn from others' mistakes."},"fromTime":"16:00","id":"conf_room4_thursday_3_15h0_15h50","toTimeMillis":1478188200000,"toTime":"16:50","roomCapacity":50,"roomName":"Marrakech","slotId":"conf_room4_thursday_3_15h0_15h50","day":"thursday"},{"roomId":"room5","notAllocated":true,"fromTimeMillis":1478185200000,"break":null,"roomSetup":"classroom","talk":null,"fromTime":"16:00","id":"conf_room5_thursday_3_15h0_15h50","toTimeMillis":1478188200000,"toTime":"16:50","roomCapacity":50,"roomName":"Algiers","slotId":"conf_room5_thursday_3_15h0_15h50","day":"thursday"},{"roomId":"room3","notAllocated":false,"fromTimeMillis":1478185200000,"break":null,"roomSetup":"classroom","talk":{"trackId":"backend","talkType":"Conference","track":"Backend technologies","summaryAsHtml":"<p>Lots of people need job scheduling, microservices communication, asynchronous message passing… There is a stable and reliable solution: AMQP.
